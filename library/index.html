<h1>National Library of the Netherlands (KB) Thesaurus Mapping Task</h1>

<p>Participants of this task are expected to align two Dutch thesauri used to
index books from two collections held by the National Library of the
Netherlands (<a href="http://www.kb.nl">KB</a>). The required alignments
links are inspired by the SKOS vocabulary. Results have been evaluated by
members of the <a href="http://stitch.cs.vu.nl">STITCH</a> project and thanks to an application-specific gold standard.</p>

<p>This task reiterates the OAEI 2007 <a href="../../2007/library/">Library track</a>.
</p>

<h2>Data sets</h2>

<p>KB maintains two big collections: the <a
href="http://netuit.kb.nl/">Deposit Collection</a>, containing all the Dutch
printed publications (one million items), and the Scientific Collection, with
about 1.4 million books mainly about the history, language and culture of the
Netherlands.</p>

<p>Each collection is described according to its own indexing system and
conceptual vocabulary. On the one hand, the Scientific Collection is
described using the <strong>GTT</strong>, a huge vocabulary containing 35,000
general concepts ranging from Wolkenkrabbers (Sky-scrapers) to Verzorging
(Care). On the other hand, the books contained in the Deposit Collection are
mainly indexed against the <strong>Brinkman thesaurus</strong>, containing a
large set of headings (more than 5,000) that are expected to serve as global
subjects of books. Both thesauri have similar coverage (there are more than
2,000 concepts having exactly the same label) but differ in granularity.</p>

<p>For each concept, the thesauri provide the usual lexical and semantic
information: preferred labels, synonyms and notes, broader and related
concepts, etc. The language of both thesauri is Dutch, but a quite
substantial part of Brinkman concepts (around 60%) come with English labels.
For the purpose of the alignment, the two thesauri have been represented
according to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">SKOS</a> model,
which provides with all these features. But an OWL version is available (see
the <a href="index.html#OWL">appendix</a> for more details).</p>

<p><strong>The goal of the task is to find semantic links between the
concepts contained by these GTT and Brinkman thesauri.</strong></p>

<p>Note that the two collections described with the GTT and Brinkman
thesaurus are overlapping: some books are hence described by the two
thesauri. This year, book descriptions will be made available to
participants, so as to enable the use of extension-based alignment
techniques.</p>

<h2>Modalities</h2>

<h3><a name="mappingconfigs">Expected Alignments</a></h3>

<p>The expected alignments shall come in the format defined for the <a
href="../align.html">Ontology Alignment
API</a>.</p>

<p>As the context of the task is clearly thesaurus-based information systems,
the alignment links to be produced shall be compatible with standard
thesaurus semantic links. Especially expected are alignment links found in
the (new) <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/">SKOS</a> vocabulary
namespace (<code>http://www.w3.org/2008/05/skos#</code>, referred to as
<code>skos:</code>):</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>skos:exactMatch</code>, which denotes equivalence between two
    concepts;</li>
  <li><code>skos:broadMatch</code> and <code>skos:narrowMatch</code>,
    denoting hierarchical generalization and specialization;</li>
  <li><code>skos:relatedMatch</code>, denoting general association.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that other semantic relations found in the former <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/mapping/spec/">SKOS mapping</a>
vocabulary namespace
(<code>http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/mapping#</code>,referred to as
<code>skosm:</code>) are <em><strong>not allowed</strong></em>:
<code>skosm:minorMatch</code>, <code>skosm:majorMatch</code>. It is however
possible to use classes of SKOS mapping that enable to map defined concepts,
even though not all be evaluated:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>skosm:AND</code> and <code>skosm:OR</code>, denoting intersection
    and union of concepts, <em>will be evaluated</em>;</li>
  <li><code>skosm:NOT</code> <em>will not be evaluated</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is also possible to handle alignment results in the form of OWL
statements (<code>rdfs:subClassOf</code>,
<code>owl:equivalentClass</code>,...). But these will be interpreted
according to the rules presented in the <a href="index.html#OWL">appendix on
OWL</a>.</p>

<p><em>Note on alignment cardinality and confidence measure:</em> </p>
<ul>
  <li>results can come with confidence measures, even though these will not
    be formally evaluated;</li>
  <li>it is allowed to have a same concept involved in different mapping
    links (1-n and m-n mapping situations)</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="evaluation" id="evaluation">Evaluation</a></h3>

<p>Evaluation of the alignments will be done by members of the STITCH team
with the help of domain experts. A special attention will be given to
application relevance. As for last year, criteria for evaluation will be
chosen according to specific application scenarios like unified thesaurus
design or book re-annotation.</p>

<p>Due to the size of the vocabulary, only sample evaluation may be carried
out for some scenarios. The modality of this sample evaluation will be
determined later, depending for example on the number of participants.</p>

<h3>Data availability</h3>
The data for the two vocabularies can be asked for by sending mail to the
organizers of the task, <a href="mailto:aisaac at few dot vu dot nl">Antoine
Isaac</a> and <a href="mailto:Henk dot Matthezing at kb dot nl">Henk
Matthezing</a>. Participating requires accepting the terms of this <a
href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/nl/deed.en">creative
commons licence</a> and committing not to use the data for a purpose other
than the OAEI campaign. [This situation is caused by the data coming from two
different environments] 

<p>Please notice that this e-mail process is not only expected to ensure
compliance with IP situation. It will also help us to keep contact with
participants, for instance if a new version of the data is produced, after a
complaint by a participant.</p>

<h2 name="OWL" id="OWL">Annex: OWL variant for the data</h2>

<p>In case the participants' tool cannot input or output the proposed SKOS
data, OWL versions are provided, and OWL alignment relationships can be
evaluated. Notice, however, that this amounts to making specific
interpretations of the original data and produced alignments, and might
reduce the quality of the final results.</p>

<p>The following conversions were made regarding the SKOS data made available
for the track:</p>
<ul>
  <li>instances of <code>skos:Concept</code> are converted into instances of
    <code>owl:Class</code>;</li>
  <li><code>skos:prefLabel</code>, <code>skos:altLabel</code> and
    <code>skos:hiddenLabel</code> statements are converted to
    <code>rdfs:label</code> statements, which removes the subtle distinctions
    that exist between these different properties (in GTT for instance, many
    <code>altLabel</code>s are not synonyms at all)</li>
  <li>various kind of <code>skos:note</code>s are converted to
    <code>rdfs:comment</code>s;</li>
  <li><code>skos:broader</code> statements are converted into
    <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> statements;</li>
  <li><code>skos:related</code> statements are converted into
    <code>rdfs:seeAlso</code> statements.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following interpretations will be made of OWL data sent <em>back</em>
by participants:</p>
<ul>
  <li>instances of <code>owl:Class</code> will be interpreted as instances of
    <code>skos:Concept</code>;</li>
  <li><code>owl:equivalentClass</code> statements will be interpreted as
    <code>skos:exactMatch</code> statements;</li>
  <li>if participants align the original concepts (as instances of
    <code>skos:Concept</code> and not <code>owl:Class</code>) using
    <code>owl:sameAs</code>, these statements will also be interpreted as
    <code>skos:exactMatch</code>s;</li>
  <li><code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> statements will be interpreted as
    <code>skos:broaderMatch</code> statements;</li>
  <li><code>rdfs:seeAlso</code> statements will be interpreted as
    <code>skos:relatedMatch</code> statements;</li>
  <li>if participants' tools output alignments involving defined classes
    using owl:intersectionOf and owl:unionOf respectively, the concerned
    statements will be interpreted as statements involving
    <code>skosm:AND</code> and <code>skosm:OR</code>. Disjunction-like
    statements (<code>owl:disjoint</code>, <code>owl:differentFrom</code>,
    <code>owl:disjointWith</code>, <code>owl:ComplementOf</code> which could
    be interpreted as statements involving <code>skosm:NOT</code>) will be
    ignored, as these are not evaluated.</li>
