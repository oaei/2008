<h1>Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative</h1>
<h1>FAO results</h1>

<h2>Data sets</h2>
 
<p>The three data sets involved in the FAO track are AGROVOC, ASFA and two
fisheries ontologies. 
They differ greatly in their model. While in AGROVOC every term is modeled as
a class with only one instance (with the same
name by prefixed with "i_"), in the current version of the OWL ASFA both
descriptors and non-descriptors
are modeled as classes, so the ontology does not contain any instance.
Concepts have annotations associated 
containing the English definition of the term. The tree sctructure of ASFA is
relatively flat, with
most concept not having subclasses, and maximum depth 4 levels (double
check).
</p>
<p>
Finally, the fisheries ontologies have a fairly simple class structure (e.g.
the species ontologies has one top 
class and four subclasses) and a large number of instances. They contain
instances in up to 3 languages 
(English, French and Spanish). 
</p>

<h2>Subtracks</h2>
 
<p>
The mapping expected between AGROVOC and ASFA is therefore to be
expected at the
class level, since both model entries of the thesaurus as classes, but
AGROVOC also adds instances to these classes. For the same reason,
the mapping between AGROVOC and the fisheries
ontologies is expected to be at the instance level, so is the mapping
between the fisheries ontologies. 
However, no strict instructions were given to participants about the
exact type of mapping expected, as one of the goal of the experiments
was to find how automatic systems can deal with a real-life situation,
when the ontologies given are designed according to different models
and have little or no documentation.
The alignment between AGROVOC and ASFA is called agrafsa, the
alignment between AGROVOC and rtms data is called agrorgbio, while the
alignment between rtms data and rtms data is called fishbio. 
The equivalence mappings requested to be found for the subtrack
 agrafsa and agrorgbio subtrack are plausible, given the similar nature of
the two resources
(thesauri used for human indexing, with overlap in the domain
covered). In the case of the fishbio subtrack this is not true, as the
 two ontologies involved are about two domains that are disjoing, although
 related (i.e. commodities and fish species). The relation between the
 two domains is given from the fact that a specific species (or more
 than one) are the primary source of the goods sold, i.e. the commodity. 
Their relation then is not an equivalence relation but can rather be
 seen as an object property with domain and range sitting in different
ontologies.
The intent of this
 subtrack is then to explore the possibility of using the machinery
 available for inferring equivalence mapping to non conventional cases. 
</p>

<h2>Evaluation procedure</h2>
 
<p>
Most participants returned equivalence mapping only, the
non-equivalence presented by one system (aroma) were ignored and
removed. Only equivalence mappings were considered, those non-equivalent were
removed.
</p>
<p> 
A reference alignment was obtained by randomly selecting a fixed
number of alignments from each system and then pooling together.
After the manual evaluation was down we realized the since some
participants did not use the correct URI, in the agrafsa dataset some
mappings were considered as different even though they were actually
the same. However, this happened only in very few cases. 
</p>

<p>Samples:
<center>
<table>
<tr bgcolor="lightgreen"><td>dataset</td><td>tot retrieved</td><td>evaluated</td><td>correct</td></tr>
<tr><td>agrafsa</td><td>2588</td><td>506</td><td>226</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="lightblue"><td>agrorgbio</td><td>742</td><td>264</td><td>156</td></tr>
<tr><td>fishbio</td><td>1013</td><td>346</td><td>131</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="yellow"><td>TOTAL</td><td>4343</td><td>1116</td><td>513</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>

<p>
Table&nbsp;1 summarizes the sample size per each data sets.
The second column (tot retrieved) contains the total number of
alingments provided by all participants per each track. The third
column (evaluated) reports the size of the sample extracted for manual
assessment. The forth column (correct) reports the number of
alignments found correct by the assessors. 
We had two assessors: one specialized in thesauri and daily working with
AGROVOC (assessing the alignments of the track ``agrafsa'') and one
specialized in fisheries data (assessing subtracks agrorgbio and
fishbio).   
Given the diffences between the ontologies considered, some
transformation had to be made in order to present data to the
assessors
in a user-friendly manner. So, in the case of AGROVOC,  
evaluators were given the English labels together with all the UF
available. 
</p>

<h2>Precision and Recall</h2>
 
<p>
For each system, precision was computed on the basis of the subset of
alignments that were manually assessed.  Recall was computed with
respect to the total number of correct alignment per subtrack, as
assessed by the human assessors. 
</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>
Table&nbsp;2 summarizes the precision and (relative)
recall values of all systems, by subtrack. 
The third column reports the total number of mappings returned by each
system, per each subtrack. All non-equivalence mappings were
discarded, but this only happened for one systems (aroma).
The fourth column reports the number of correct alignments as judged
by the assessors, while the fifth column reports the number of
alignments from the system that were evaluated.
Finally, the sixth and seventh columns reports the values of precision
and recall computed as described above. 
The star next to the alignment system marks the systems that alignmed
proprties.
