Concept naming over the taxonomic structure is a useful indicator
of the quality of design as well as source of information exploitable for various
tasks such as ontology refactoring and mapping. We analysed collections of
OWL ontologies with the aim of determining the frequency of several combined
name&graph patterns potentially indicating underlying semantic structures. Such
structures range from simple set-theoretic subsumption to more complex constructions
such as parallel taxonomies of different entity types. The final goal is
to help refactor legacy ontologies as well as to ease automatic alignment among
different models. The results show that in most ontologies there is a significant
number of occurrences of such patterns. Moreover, their detection even using very
simple methods has precision sufficient for a semi-automated analysis scenario.

The WWW is an important channel of information exchange in many domains, including
the medical one. The ever increasing amount of freely available healthcare-related information
generates, on the one hand, excellent conditions for self-education of patients as well as
physicians, but on the other hand entails substantial risks if such information is trusted
irrespective of low competence or even bad intentions of its authors. This is why medical website
certification (also called ‘quality labeling’) by renowned authorities is of high importance. In this
respect, it recently became obvious that the labeling process could benefit from employment of
web mining and information extraction techniques, in combination with flexible methods of
web-based information management developed within the semantic web initiative. Achieving
such synergy is the central issue in the MedIEQ project. The AQUA (Assisting QUality
Assessment) system, developed within the MedIEQ project, aims to provide the infrastructure
and the means to organize and support various aspects of the daily work of labeling experts.

The increasing amount of freely available health-related web content generates, on one hand, excellent conditions
for self-education of patients as well as physicians, but on the other hand entails substantial risks if such information is trusted
irrespective of low competence or even bad intentions of its authors. This is why medical web resources accreditation by
renowned authorities is of high importance. However, various health web content surveys show that the proportion of
accredited web resources is insufficient due to the difficulty of the labeling authorities to cope with the amount and dynamics of
the medical web. In this paper, we address the problem of automating the accreditation of medical web content. To this end,
we present a system which provides the infrastructure and the means to organize and support various aspects of the daily work

The work described here concerns the use of complementary resources in sports video analysis; soccer in our case. Structured web data
such as match tables with teams, player names, score goals, substitutions, etc. and multiple, unstructured, textual web data sources
(minute-by-minute match reports) are processed with an ontology-based information extraction tool to extract and annotate events and
entities according to the SmartWeb soccer ontology. Through the temporal alignment of the primary A/V data (soccer videos) with the
textual and structured complementary resources, these extracted and semantically organized events can be used as indicators for video
segment extraction and semantic classification, i.e. occurrences of particular events in the complementary resources can be used to
classify the corresponding video segment, enabling semantic indexing and retrieval of soccer videos.

We present a framework for efficiently exploiting free-text annotations as a complementary resource to image classification. 
A novel approach called Semantic Concept Mapping (SCM) is used to classify entities occurring in the text to a custom-defined set of concepts. 
SCM performs unsupervised classification by exploiting the relations between common entities codified in the Wordnet thesaurus. 
SCM exploits Targeted Hypernym Discovery (THD) to map unknown entities extracted from the text to concepts in Wordnet. 
We show how the result of SCM/THD can be fused with the outcome of Knowledge Assisted Image Analysis (KAA), 
a classification algorithm that extracts and labels multiple segments from an image. 
In the experimental evaluation, THD achieved an accuracy of 75%, and SCM an accuracy of 52%.
In one of the first experiments with fusing the results of a free-text and image-content classifier, SCM/THD + KAA
achieved a relative improvement of 49% and 31% over the text-only and image-content-only baselines.

The motivation of this paper is to increase the user perceived precision of results of Content Based Information Retrieval
(CBIR) systems with Query Refinement (QR), Visual Analysis (VA) and Relevance Feedback (RF) algorithms. The proposed
algorithms were implemented as modules into K-Space CBIR system. The QR module discovers hypernyms for the given
query from a free text corpus (Wikipedia) and uses these hypernyms as refinements for the original query. Extracting
hypernyms from Wikipedia makes it possible to apply query refinement to more queries than in related approaches that use
static predefined thesaurus such as Wordnet. The VA Module uses the K-Means algorithm for clustering the images based
on low-level features. The RF Module uses the preference information expressed by the user to build user profiles by
applying SOM-based supervised classification, which is further optimized by a hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
algorithm. The experiments evaluating the performance of QR and VA modules show promising results.

Diverse types of structured domain models are nowadays in use in
various contexts. On the one hand there are generic models, especially domain
ontologies, which are typically used in applications with artificial intelligence
(reasoning) flavor; on the other hand there are more specific models that only
come to use in areas like software engineering or business analysis.
Furthermore, the discipline of information extraction has invented very specific
knowledge models called extraction ontologies, whose purpose is to help
extract and semantically annotate textual data. In this paper we present a
method of authoring extraction ontologies (more specifically, their abstract
constituents called presentation ontologies) via reusing different types of other
knowledge models, especially domain ontologies and UML models. Our
priority is to maintain consistency between extracted data and those prior
models.

Extraction of meaningful content from collections of web pages with
unknown structure is a challenging task, which can only be successfully accomplished
by exploiting multiple heterogeneous resources. In the Ex information
extraction tool, so-called extraction ontologies are used by human designers to
specify the domain semantics, to manually provide extraction evidence, as well
as to define extraction subtasks to be carried out via trainable classifiers. Elements
of an extraction ontology can be endowed with probability estimates, which are
used for selection and ranking of attribute and instance candidates to be extracted.
At the same time, HTML formatting regularities are locally exploited.

As the number of health-related web sites in various languages increases,
it is more than necessary to implement control mechanisms that give the users adequate guarantee
that the web resources they are visiting, meet a minimum level of quality standards.
Based upon state-of-the-art technology in the areas of semantic web, content analysis and quality labeling,
the AQUA system, designed for the EC-funded project MedIEQ, aims
to support the automation of the labeling process in health-related web content.
AQUA provides tools that crawl the web to locate unlabelled health web resources in different
European languages, as well as tools that traverse websites, identify and extract information
and, upon this information, propose labels or monitor already labeled resources.
Two major steps in this automated labeling process are web content collection and information extraction.
This paper focuses on content collection. We describe existing approaches, present the architecture
of the content collection toolkit and how this is integrated within the AQUA system,
and discuss our initial experimental results in the English language
(six more languages will be covered by the end of the project).</p>

Extraction ontologies represent a novel paradigm in web information
extraction (as one of ‘deductive’ species of web mining) allowing to swiftly proceed
from initial domain modelling to running a functional prototype, without
the necessity of collecting and labelling large amounts of training examples. Bottlenecks
in this approach are however the tedium of developing an extraction
ontology adequately covering the semantic scope of web data to be processed
and the difficulty of combining the ontology-based approach with inductive or
wrapper-based approaches.We report on an ongoing project aiming at developing
a web information extraction tool based on richly-structured extraction ontologies
and with additional possibility of (1) semi-automatically constructing these from
third-party domain ontologies, (2) absorbing the results of inductive learning for
subtasks where pre-labelled data abound, and (3) actively exploiting formatting
regularities in the wrapper style.

Composition of simpler web services into custom applications is understood
as promising technique for information requests in a heterogeneous and
changing environment. This is also relevant for applications characterised as deductive
web mining (DWM). We suggest to use problem-solving methods (PSMs)
as templates for composed services. We developed a multi-dimensional, ontologybased
framework, and a collection of PSMs, which enable to characterise DWM
applications at an abstract level; we describe several existing applications in this
framework. We show that the heterogeneity and unboundedness of the web demands
for some modifications of the PSM paradigm used in the context of traditional arti-
ficial intelligence. Finally, as simple proof of concept, we simulate automated DWM
service composition on a small collection of services, PSM-based templates, data
objects and ontological knowledge, all implemented in Prolog.

Many ontology mapping systems nowadays exist.
In order to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, benchmark datasets (ontology collections) have been created, several of which have been used in the most recent edition of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI).
While most OAEI tracks rely on straightforward comparison of the results achieved by the mapping systems with some kind of reference mapping created a priori, the 'conference' track (based on the OntoFarm collection of heterogeneous 'conference organisation' ontologies) instead encompassed multiway manual as well as automated analysis of mapping results themselves, with `correct' and `incorrect' cases determined a posteriori.
The manual analysis consisted in simple labelling of discovered mappings plus discussion of selected cases (`casuistics') within a face-to-face consensus building workshop.
The automated analysis relied on two different tools: the Drago system for testing the consistency of aligned ontologies and the LISp-Miner system for discovering frequent associations in mapping meta-data including the phenomenon of graph-based mapping patterns.
The results potentially provide specific feedback to the developers and users of mining tools, and generally indicate that automated mapping can rarely be successful without considering the larger context and possibly deeper semantics of the entities involved.

</strong>
The structure of ontologies that are considered as input to information extraction is mostly rather simple.
In this paper we report on our ongoing effort of using rich ontologies with numerous constraints over the information to be extracted. 
Important aspects of the approach are the coupling of user-defined ontologies with other sources of knowledge such as training data and document formatting structures, and the distinction between proper domain ontologies and so-called presentation ontologies, where the latter (as `pragmatic bridges' over the `semantic gap') can partially be derived from the former.
The extraction tool under construction builds on experience from an ongoing application in the domain of product catalogue analysis, and attempts to offer high flexibility with respect to availability of various input information sources.

<a href="http://nb.vse.cz/%7Esvatek/rainbow/raws05psm.pdf">Full paper</a>.
</strong>
Template-based composition of web services is considered as useful middle-way between their manual 'programming in the large' and fully automatic 'AI-planning-style' composition.
This is also relevant for applications analysing the content and structure of the web space.
As simple proof of concept, we simulate this approach on a collection of services, templates, data objects and ontological knowledge, all implemented in Prolog.
The underlying task is multi-way recognition of sites containing pornography, understood as instance of classification task.

</strong>
Knowledge-based web information extraction methods can
achieve very high precision in restricted domains; they are however slow
and suffer from performance degradation beyond their specific domain.
We thus plan to adapt an existing XML storage and query engine to
act as efficient pre-processor for such methods. The critical point of the
approach is the amount of information provided as XML environment of
the start-up terms/elements. For this purpose, we carried out a statistical
analysis of depth distribution in the WebTREC collection.

Ontology learning from texts has been proposed as a technology helping ontology designers in the modelling process.
Within ontology learning, the discovery of non-taxonomic relations is understood as the problem least addressed.
We propose a technique for extraction of lexical items that may give cue in assigning semantic labels to otherwise `anonymous' non-taxonomic relations.
The technique has been implemented as extension to the existing Text-to-Onto tool. 
Experiments have been carried out on a collection of texts describing tour destinations as well as on a semantically annotated general corpus. 
The paper also discusses evaluation aspects of relation labelling, among which the distinction of prior and posterior precision looks as most important.

Knowledge-intensive methods that can altogether be characterised as deductive web mining (DWM) already act as supporting technology for building the semantic web.
Reusable knowledge-level descriptions may further ease the deployment of DWM tools.
We developed a multi-dimensional, ontology-based framework, and a collection of problem-solving methods, which enable to characterise DWM applications at an abstract level.
We show that the heterogeneity and unboundedness of the web demands for some modifications of the problem-solving method paradigm used in the context of traditional artificial intelligence.

Approaches to formalisation of medical guidelines can be divided into model-centric and document-centric. While model-centric approaches dominate in the development of clinical decision support applications, document-centric, mark-up-based formalisation is suitable for application tasks requiring the 'literal' content of the document to be transferred into the formal model. Examples of such tasks are logical verification of the document or compliance analysis of health records. 
The quality and efficiency of document-centric formalisation can be improved using a decomposition of the whole process into several explicit steps. We present a methodology and software tool supporting the step-by-step formalisation process. The knowledge elements can be marked up in the source text, refined to a tree structure with increasing level of detail, rearranged into an XML knowledge base, and, finally, exported into the operational representation. User-definable transformation rules enable to automate a large part of the process. 
The approach is being tested in the domain of cardiology. For parts of the WHO/ISH Guidelines for Hypertension, the process has been carried out through all the stages, to the form of executable application, generated automatically from the XML knowledge base.

Yet, many aspects of this process are pre-determined, and their automation is highly desirable. 
We implemented a software tool (called Stepper) supporting interactive step-by-step transformation of ‚knowledge blocks'. 
The transformation is governed by rules expressed in a new 'interactive transformation' language (called XKBT), 
while its non-interactive aspects are handled by embedded XSLT rules.

</strong>
The main difficulties of converting the original textual
form of medical guidelines to a computer-tractable form are connected both
with the ambiguity of the natural language text and with the complexity of
the resulting formal (and operational) representation. Proceeding directly
from one to the other is thus an extremely demanding task. The proposed
Guide-X methodology addresses this problem by breaking the whole process of
guideline operationalisation into several steps, each of which requires a
different mixture of types (medical, knowledge representation,
typographical) and degrees of expertise. The principal technology used is
that of XML tagging (using both pre-existing and newly developed languages).
The result of each step is connected, element-by-element, to the results of
previous steps, thus making the verification and revision of the
operationalisation process easier. The methodology is currently being tested
in the field of hypertension treatment, within the framework of the Medical
Guideline Technology project of the EU Fourth Framework Programme.
