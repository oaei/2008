<h1>Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative</h1>
<h1>2008 Campaign</h1>

<p>The increasing number of methods available for schema matching/ontology integration 
  suggests the need to establish a consensus for evaluation of these methods. 
Since 2004, <a href="https://oaei.ontologymatching.org">OAEI</a> organizes evaluation campaigns aiming at
  evaluating ontology matching technologies (see
  <a href="https://oaei.ontologymatching.org/2004/">https://oaei.ontologymatching.org/2004/</a>,
  <a href="https://oaei.ontologymatching.org/2005">https://oaei.ontologymatching.org/2005</a>,
  <a href="https://oaei.ontologymatching.org/2006">https://oaei.ontologymatching.org/2006</a>,
  and <a href="https://oaei.ontologymatching.org/2007">https://oaei.ontologymatching.org/2007</a>).</p>
<p>The OAEI 2008 campaign is
  associated to the <a href="https://iswc2008.semanticweb.org">ISWC</a>
  <a href="https://om2008.ontologymatching.org">Ontology matching
    workshop</a>
  to be held at Karlsruhe, Germany on Sunday October 26, 2008.</p>


<h2>Problems</h2>

<p>This year's campaign consists of four tracks gathering eight data
  sets and different evaluation modalities.
<dl compact="1">
<dt>Comparison track: <a href="benchmarks">benchmark2008</a></dt><dd>
  Like in previous campaigns, a <b>systematic benchmark series</b> has 
  been produced. The goal of this benchmark series is to identify the areas in 
  which each alignment algorithm is strong and weak. The test is based on one 
  particular ontology dedicated to the very narrow domain of
  bibliography and a 
  number of alternative ontologies of the same domain for which alignments are 
  provided.</dd>
<dt>Expressive ontologies</dt><dd>
<dl compact="1">
<dt><a
  href="anatomy/">anatomy</a></dt><dd>The <b>anatomy</b>
  real world case is about matching the Adult Mouse Anatomy (2744 classes) and the NCI Thesaurus (3304 classes) describing the human anatomy.</dd>
<dt><a
  href="fao/">fao</a></dt><dd> features networked ontologies from domains
related to fisheries manipulated by the Food and Agricultural
Organization of the United Nations (FAO).</dd>
</dl></dd>
<dt>Directories and thesauri</dt><dd>
<dl compact="1">
<dt><a href="directory/">directory</a></dt><dd>The <b>directory</b> real world case consists of matching web
  sites directories (like open directory or Yahoo's). It is more than
  4 thousand elementary tests.</dd>
<dt><a href="mldirectory/">mldirectory</a></dt><dd>The <b>mldirectory</b> real world case consists of matching web
  sites directories (like Dmoz, Licos and Yahoo's) in different
  languages (English and Japanese). These are exerpts of the
  directories which contain around one thousand categories.</dd>
<dt><a href="library/">library</a></dt><dd>Two
    SKOS thesauri about <b>books</b> have to be aligned using relations from the SKOS Mapping vocabulary. Samples of the results are evaluated by domain experts. 
</dd>
<dt><a href="vlcr/">very large crosslingual resources</a></dt><dd>
This real world test case requires matching of very large resources (<b>vlcr</b>)
available on the web, viz. DBPedia, WordNet and the Dutch audiovisual
archive (GTAA), DBPedia is multilingual and GTAA is in Dutch.
</dd>
</dl></dd> 
<dt>Consensus workshop: <a href="conference/">conference</a></dt><dd>
Participants will be asked to freely explore a collection of
ontologies used for organising conferences (the domain being well
understandable for every researcher) with regard to two possible tasks
(generic correspondences or application-specific
correspondences). Results will be evaluated a 
posteriori in part manually and in part by
data-mining techniques and logical reasoning techniques. There
will also be evaluation against reference mapping based on small
subset of the whole collection.
</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<p>We summarize below the variation between the results expected by
  these tests (all results are given in the Alignment format):
<center>
<table>
<tr><td>test</td><td>language</td><td>relations</td><td>confidence</td><td>Modalities</td><td>Language</td><td>Size</td></tr>
<tr><td>benchmarks</td><td>OWL</td><td>=</td><td>[0 1]</td><td>open</td><td>EN</td><td>(36+61)*2*49</td></tr>
<tr><td>anatomy</td><td>OWL</td><td>=</td><td>[0 1]</td><td>blind</td><td>EN</td><td>3k*3k</td></tr>
<tr><td>fao</td><td>OWL</td><td>=</td><td>1</td><td>expert</td><td>EN+FR+ES</td><td></td></tr>
<!--tr><td></td><td>OWL</td><td>=</td><td>1</td><td>blind</td><td>EN</td><td></td></tr-->
<tr><td>directory</td><td>OWL</td><td>=</td><td>1</td><td>blind</td><td>EN</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>mdirectory</td><td>OWL</td><td>=</td><td>1</td><td>blind</td><td>EN+JP</td><td></td></tr>

<tr><td>library<br/>vlcr<br/></td><td>SKOS<br/>+OWL</td><td>exactMatch,<br
								 />narrowMatch,<br
										  />broadMatch</td><td>1</td><td>blind</td><td>EN+DU</td></tr>

<tr><td>conference</td><td>OWL-DL</td><td>=, <=</td><td>[0 1]</td><td>blind+consensual</td><td>EN</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
[0 1] in the 'confidence-column' means that submission with confidence values in the range [0 1] are preferred, but does not exclude systems which do not distinguish between different confidence values.</p>

<h2>Evaluation process</h2>

<p>Each data set has a different evaluation process. They can be
  roughly divided into four groups:
<dl compact="1">
<dt>benchmark: open</dt><dd>benchmark tests are provided with the
    expected results. Participants must return their obtained results
    to organisers;</dd>
<dt>anatomy, directory, mldirectory, library, vlcr: blind</dt><dd>these are
    blind tests, i.e., participants do not know the results and must
    return their results to organisers;</dd> 
<dt>fao: expert</dt><dd>the results themselves are evaluated by
    experts a posteriori on a sample of the results;</dd>
<dt>conference: consensus</dt><dd>requires that participants
    send their results to organisers, the results are not
    pre-determined through reference alignments but computed and/or
    discussed as a consensus among given results.</dd>
<dt></dt><dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>However, the evaluation will be processed in the same three
  successive steps as before.</p>

<h3>Preparatory Phase </h3>

<p>Ontologies are described in OWL-DL and serialized 
  in the RDF/XML format. The expected alignments are provided in the
  <a href="align.html">Alignment format</a> expressed in RDF/XML.
<p>The ontologies and alignments of the evaluation are provided in
  advance during the period between May 19th and June 15th. This gives
  potential participants the occasion to send observations, bug
  corrections, remarks and other test cases to the organizers. The
  goal of this primary period is to be sure that the delivered 
  tests make sense to the participants. The feedback is important, so
  all participants should not hesitate to provide it. The tests will
  certainly change after this period, but only for ensuring a better
  participation to the tests. The final test base has been released on
  July 1st.</p>

<h3>Execution Phase </h3>

<p>During the execution phase the <b>participants</b> will use their
  algorithms to automatically match the ontologies. 
  Participants should only use one algorithm and the same set of
  parameters for all tests in all tracks. Of course, it is fair to
  select the 
  set of parameters that provide the best results (for the tests where
  results are known). Beside the
  parameters the input of the algorithms must be the two provided
  ontology to match and any general purpose resource available to
  everyone (that is no resourse especially designed for the test). In
  particular, participants should not use the data (ontologies
  and results) from other test sets to help their algorithm. And
  cheating is not fair...</p>
<p>The deadline for delivering final results is September 26th,
  sharp. However, it is <i>highly advised</i> that participants send
  results before (preferably by September 1st) to the organisers so
  that they can check that they will be able to evaluate the results
  smoothly and can provide some feedback to participants.</>
<p><b>Participants</b> will provide their alignment for each test
  in the <a href="align.html">Alignment
  format</a>. The results will be provided in a <i>zip</i> file containing
  one directory per test (named after its number) and each directory
  containing one result file in the
  RDF/XML <a href="align.html">Alignment 
  format</a> with always the same name
  (e.g., participant.rdf replacing "participant" by the name you want
  your system to appear in the results, limited to 6 alphanumeric characters). This should yield the following structure:
<pre>
participant.zip
+- benchmarks
|  +- 101
|  |  +- participant.rdf
|  +- 103
|  |  +- participant.rdf
|  + ...
+- anatomy
|  +- 1
|  |  +- participant.rdf
|  +- 2
|  |  +- participant.rdf
|  +- ...
+- directory
|  +- 1
|  |  +- participant.rdf
|  + ...
+ ...
</pre>
</p>
<p>Participants will also provide, for September 26th, a paper to be
  published in the proceedings and a link to their program and
  parameter set.</a>
<p>The only interesting alignments are those involving classes and
  properties of the given ontologies. So the alignments should not
  align individuals, nor entities from the external ontologies.</p>

<h3>Evaluation Phase</h3>

<p>The <b>organizers</b> will evaluate the results of the algorithms
  used by the participants and provide comparisons on the basis of the
  provided alignments.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that it will be possible to process
  automatically the provided results, <b>participants</b>
  are requested to provide (preliminary) results by September 1st. In
  the case of blind tests only the organizers will do the evaluation
  with regard to the withheld alignments. In the case of double blind
  tests, the <b>participants</b> will provide a version of their
  system and the values of the parameters if any.</p>
<p>An email with the location
  of the required zip files must be sent to the contact addresses below.
</p>
<p>The standard evaluation measures will be precision and recall
  computed against the reference alignments. For the matter of
  aggregation of the measures we will use weighted harmonic means
  (weight being the size of reference alignment). 
  <a
  href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/text/htdocs/imt_quality.htm?_template=/ocom/ocom_item_templates/print">Precision/recall
  graphs</a> will also be computed, so it is advised that participants
  provide their results with a weight to each correspondence they
  found (participants can provide two alignment results:
  &lt;name&gt;.rdf for the selected alignment and
  &lt;name&gt;-full.rdf for the alignment with weights.</p> 
<p>Furthermore, it is planned to
  introduce new measures addressing some limitations of precision and
  recall. These will be presented at the workshop discussion
  in order for the participants to provide feedback on the
  opportunity to use them in a further evaluation.</p>

<h2>Presentation</h2>

<p>From the results of the experiments the participants are expected
  to provide the organisers with a paper to be published in the proceedings   
  of the workshop. 
  The paper must be no more than 8 pages long and formatted using the
  <a href="https://www.springer.com/lncs">LNCS Style</a>.
  To ensure easy comparability among the participants it has to follow the given 
  outline. A package with LaTeX and Word templates is made available <a href="templates.zip">here</a>.

<p>The results from both selected participants and organizers will be presented 
  at the <a href="https://om2008.ontologymatching.org"> Workshop on 
  Ontology matching</a> at ISWC 2008 taking place at Karlsruhe (Germany) on October, 
  26th, 2008. We hope to see you there.</p>

<h2>Tools and material</h2>

<p>Here are some tools that may help participants.</p>

<h3>Processing tools</h3>

<p><b>Participants</b> may use the <a
  href="align.html">Alignment API</a> for generating and manipulating their alignments (in particular for computing 
  evaluation of results). </p>

<h3>SKOS conversion tools</h3>

<p>The <b>participants</b> may use <a href="skos2owl.html">various options</a> if they need to convert SKOS vocabularies into OWL.</p>

<h3>OWL-N3 conversion tools</h3>

<p>Vassilis Spiliopoulos pointed out to <a href="http://www.altova.com/downloadtrialsemanticworks.html?gclid=CNXR9ubdu4wCFQ-HlAod-QXdVg">Altova
    transformer</a> from OWL to N3 notation. This can be useful for
    some. This is a commercial tool with a 30 days free trial.</a>
