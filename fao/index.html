<h1>FAO</h1>

<p>The task consists of matching networked ontologies from domains
related to fisheries manipulated by the Food and Agricultural
Organization of the United Nations (FAO). These corresponds to the
ontologisation of resources like thesauri (ASFA, Agrovoc) or databases
(Fisheries) which are currently in exploitation at FAO. They are made
of several thousand classes each.</p>

<h2>Data sets</h2>

<p>The task is made of three data sets which are ontologies in OWL.</p>

<!--h3>Versions</h3>
<p>Please uncomment and fill if there are several versions of the
  dataset.</p-->

<h3>AGROVOC</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.fao.org/aims/ag_intro.htm">AGROVOC</a> is a
  multilingual, structured and controlled vocabulary designed to cover
  the terminology of all subject fields in agriculture, forestry,
  fisheries, food and related domains (e.g. environment). We use here
  the.</p>

<p>We selected some "modules" of the of modular transcription of AGROVOC in OWL (only English, French, Spanish):
<ul>
<li>"organisms", in OWL format: organism.owl</li>
<li>"vehicles" (including vessels): vehicles.owl</li>
<li>"fishing gear": fishing-gear.owl</li>
</ul>
They all import: aos.owl, asc.owl, faopa.owl.</p>

<p>The conversion of AGROVOC into an OWL ontology is work in progress. Depending
on the 
development of the conversion and on the feedback we receive from
participants these moduels could be 
improved (and/or include other languages), or the entire AGROVOC-OWL could be
given.</p>

<p>The resulting dataset is made of around 2.500 classes and 
  available <a href="fishing-gear.zip">here</a>.</p>

<h3>ASFA</h3>

<p>Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts (<a href="http://www.fao.org/fishery/asfa/8">ASFA</a>)
is an abstracting and indexing service covering the world's literature
on the science, technology, management, and conservation of marine,
brackish water, and freshwater resources and environments, including
their socio-economic and legal aspects. It is available in English,
French and Spanish.</p>

<p>We use a OWL transcription of ASFA. A web broswer of the thesaurus
is available at: http://www4.fao.org/asfa/asfa.htm</p>

<p>The afsa-d ontology is made of around 10.000 classes and is
  available <a href="asfa-d.zip">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Fisheries ontologies</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.fao.org/aims/neon.jsp">fishery
ontologies</a> are developed by FAO, in the context of
the <a href="http://www.neon-project.org">NeOn project</a> as a set of modular OWL ontologies
covering the Fishery domain.</p>
<p>These ontologies are available from <a href="http://www.fao.org/aims/neon.jsp">http://www.fao.org/aims/neon.jsp</a> where one
can also find information about the coding system modelled in the 
ontologies. Please note that the ontologies to consider are those that are
"populated with instances" (it is expected that the result will
contain instances matched against classes).
<ul>
<li>Land areas</li>
<li>Biological entities</li>
<li>Fisheries commodities</li>
<li>Vessel types and size</li>
<li>Gear types</li>
</ul>
Or as a comprehensive zip file.
</p>

<h2>Modalities</h2>

<p>The task consists of finding alignements between
<ul>
<li>AGROVOC and ASFA</li>
<li>AGROVOC organism module and biological entities</li>
<!--li>AGROVOC gear module and gear types</li>
<li>AGROVOC vessels and vessel types and size</li-->
<li>fisheries commodities and biological entities</li>
</ul>
Each alignment will be returned in
an <a href="../align.html">alignment</a> file systemname.rdf in a separate
directory (agrafsa, agrorgbio, agrgear, agrvess, fishbio). So this
should be like:
<pre>
|- agrafsa/systemname.rdf
|- agrorgbio/systemname.rdf
|- fishbio/systemname.rdf
</pre>
<!--|- agrgear/systemname.rdf
|- agrvess/systemname.rdf-->
</p>

<p>Mappings are not known in advance. Domain experts will assess samples of the
mappings proposed and return participats results.</p>

<h2>Schedule</h2>

<p>The schedule is that of the <a href="..">OAEI 2008 campaign</a>.</p>
